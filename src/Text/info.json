    "about": "This 'The Reader Book Club' is founded by the ideas of Wai Yan Thein and his friend Min Hlaing Bwar since two years ago.  The readers and their friends who were reading the books have been regularly discussing about the different types of books, distinctive books and nonidentical books on every Fridays. Divergent books, varieties of speculation, thoughts and ideas on a diminutive sentence or paragraph were handing out the members to widen our knowledge and vibes on every last days of weekdays. Besides, it aims to extend existing mastery. Then, there is also a quote that' Today a reader, Tomorrow a leader'  by the author Margaret Fuller. One more quote of Charles W.Eliot is that 'Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the most patient of teachers.
